# Business-360-Project

AtliQ Hardware has been on a rapid growth trajectory and is now taking a bold step by integrating data analytics through Power BI. This initiative is designed to not only outpace competitors but also to empower the company with data-driven insights across critical areas like finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain.
I played a key role in bringing this project to life, leveraging the expertise gained from the Codebasics Power BI Course.

# Company's Background
AtliQ Hardware has rapidly expanded its global footprint, opening new business ventures worldwide. Specializing in computers and accessories, the company operates through three key channels:
* retailers
* direct sales 
* distributors.
  
However, a recent misstep occurred when AtliQ opened a store in America based on intuition, surveys, and basic Excel analysis, resulting in unexpected losses. 
Meanwhile, competitors with robust analytics teams are making data-driven decisions, leaving AtliQ with no choice but to build its own analytics team to stay competitive and ensure future success.

In the project's kickoff session, it's crucial to clarify the purpose, goals, and any lingering questions to ensure a successful launch.

# Before Starting the Project: Key Questions to Ask:

* What are the primary objectives and goals of the project?
* Who are the key stakeholders, and what are their expectations?
* What data sources will be used, and how accessible are they?
* What are the timelines and deadlines for the project?
* What are the key performance indicators (KPIs) that need to be tracked?
* What resources and tools are available for the project?
* What are the potential risks or challenges, and how can they be mitigated?
* What level of data security and privacy is required?
* How will success be measured?
* What is the preferred format for the final deliverables?

# Understanding of Dataset
Understanding what data is available will be more helpful while doing analysis. before jumping on to the analysis get good understanding of what are data available.

Dimension table : It will have the static data like details of customer and products

Fact table : It will have the data about the transactions

# Importing data into Power BI
   * As the database is MySQL in this project, we need to import the datasets from Mysql database to PowerBi by providing the Database access credential.


# Data Model
* Data modeling is the foundation of any report, acting as the bedrock upon which all visuals are built.
* A well-structured data model is crucial because poor modeling can significantly impact the overall performance of the report.
* Adhering to best practices in data modeling is essential to ensure efficiency and accuracy. 
* In this project, we adopted the Snowflake data modeling approach to ensure optimal performance and scalability.
